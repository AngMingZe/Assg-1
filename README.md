# Assg-1
Every html file has a navigation bar to make going around each website easier. 

# Index.html:
This page contains the intro, describing who I am. 
I also included my education and work experience to show a good first impression. 

# Achievement.html:
This page showcases the achievements, not all of the achievements are real though. 
There are a few line breaks at the bottom of the file to make the background picture fill the entire page. 

# Projects.html:
This page shows my projects. I included images and text beside the images to make it look better.

# Contact.html:
It shows my phone number and email as well as a link to my LinkedIn profile. 
There is also an email me button which will display a thank you message when clicked. 

# Style.css:
The file that contains my styles for different classes, ID and elements.

# Javascript.js:
The file that contains the functions I used to make the webpage more interactive. 

# Design Process
My design process is to make a resume to showcase my strengths to appeal to employers. I made multiple sections for employers to navigate around and see my different accomplishments. As an employer, I would like to easily see what the employee's resume has, I would normally expect the webpage to be easily understandable and have a navigation bar to allow easy access to information. 

# Features 
Feature 1: A navigation bar is created to allow users to access the home, achievement, project and contact pages. 
Feature 2: Button which allow users to open a new tab and email me. That button will also display a thank you message when pressed to express gratitude to the user, potentially an employer.  
Feature 3: A button to my LinkedIn profile for employers to view my LinkedIn profile

# Features left to implement
Feature 1: A mouse over space to show which achievement is from which year.
