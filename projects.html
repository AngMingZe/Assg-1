            <p style="display:inline-block;"> <u>Maple story code for patch 2.21</u><br>
                In 2015, I created a model of Will Smith in Maple story as an easter egg. 
                It was a special event and maple story invited me and some others to plan and add the Will Smith model inside. 
                This is a very important project for me as back then, Maple Story was a popular game and 
                being a part of such a project gave me experience.

                The character models are mostly modelled by my team members and me 
                but I have contributed a fair share towards the game.

            <p style="display:inline-block;"> <u>C# full course</u><br>I have created a full guide on how to use C#. 
                It is mainly for beginners who just started using C# and need a way to learn how to utilize a programming language. 
                My course offers many different lessons like teaching variables and different data types.
